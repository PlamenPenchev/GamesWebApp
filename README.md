# GamesWebApp
This is a project I've made for my University course - Information Systems Development with .Net. It is a simple application connected to MySQL server. The database consists of 3 tables - Games, Developers and GameDev (m:n) connection between the games and the developers. CRUD operation over the tables. The system was designed using Database first approach. Added a functionality to save a file into the database and display it as a picture in the detailed info of the products. The Application supports Facebook log-in, which is implemented as a service.
